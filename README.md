### 📘 `README.md` — ESG Practices in Enterprises: Predictive Analytics and Impact Simulation

```markdown
# 🌿 ESG Practices in Enterprises
### A Predictive, Interpretable, and Visual Analytics Platform for ESG Score Modeling

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is an end-to-end system to **predict, evaluate, and simulate ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scores** for companies based on structured ESG indicators. Built from scratch using only `NumPy` and `Pandas`, it demonstrates a transparent, customizable machine learning pipeline with polynomial regression and feature engineering.

> ⚙️ The goal: Help enterprises, analysts, and regulators **understand and simulate ESG performance** through interpretable models and accurate predictions.

## 🧠 Models & Features

### ✅ Current Modules
| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Polynomial Regression Model** | Linear regression with polynomial feature expansion (squares + pairwise interactions). |
| **Preprocessing Engine** | Feature extraction, normalization, and test/train splitting. |
| **Evaluation Module** | MSE, R², custom accuracy, and 3 visualization plots. |
| **Feature Engineering** | Manual polynomial expansion with interpretability. |

### 🔬 Features Used (16 ESG Indicators)
These indicators serve as the input variables:
- Environmental: `CO2_Emissions`, `Renewable_Energy`, `Water_Consumption`, `Waste_Management`, `Biodiversity_Impact`
- Social: `Gender_Diversity`, `Employee_Satisfaction`, `Community_Investment`, `Safety_Incidents`, `Labor_Rights`
- Governance: `Board_Diversity`, `Executive_Pay_Ratio`, `Transparency`, `Shareholder_Rights`, `Anti_Corruption`, `Political_Donations`

---

## 📊 Visual Analytics

The evaluation module generates:

1. **📈 Predicted vs Actual ESG Score Scatter Plot**
2. **📉 Residual Distribution Histogram**
3. **📊 Sample ESG Score Comparison (Bar Plot)**

These help in understanding model fit, bias, and variance.

---

## 🔍 Model Metrics

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures average squared error between predicted and actual ESG scores.
- **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**: Represents how well the model explains score variability.
- **Custom Accuracy**: % of predictions within ±5 ESG points of the true score.

---

## 💾 Data Pipeline

### 1. Preprocessing
```bash
python preprocess.py
```
- Cleans `raw_data.csv`
- Normalizes and saves as `test_data_integrated.csv`

### 2. Training
```bash
python integrated_train_poly_improved.py
```
- Loads `test_data_integrated.csv`
- Applies polynomial expansion
- Normalizes using calculated μ and σ
- Trains custom regression model (no ML libraries used)
- Saves `W`, `b`, `mu_poly`, and `sigma_poly` to `.npz`

### 3. Evaluation
```bash
python integrated_evaluate_poly_improved.py
```
- Loads saved `.npz` model
- Evaluates on the test set
- Visualizes performance with:
  - Prediction scatter
  - Residual histogram
  - Sample prediction bar chart

---

## 🧪 Example Output

```
Test expanded feature shape: (200, 152)
Mean Squared Error on test set: 7.346
R² Score on test set: 0.931
Custom Regression Accuracy (error <= 5): 86.5%

Sample Predictions:
Predicted ESG: 72.1, Actual ESG: 74
Predicted ESG: 83.5, Actual ESG: 80
...
```

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Data Processing | `Pandas`, `NumPy` |
| Model Training | Manual Linear Regression (no sklearn) |
| Visualization | `matplotlib`, `seaborn` |
| Storage | `.npz` files for weights and stats |

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- ✅ **No External ML Libraries**: Implements everything from scratch using only core Python tools.
- 🧮 **Interpretable Regression**: Prioritizes explainability over black-box performance.
- 🧪 **Testable & Modular**: Cleanly separated preprocessing, training, evaluation.
